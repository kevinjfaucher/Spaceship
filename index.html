    <h1>Greetings, _______ from Earth!</h1>

    <!-- 
    
    <label>: This is an HTML element used to provide a caption or description for a form control, like an <input>. 
    It's especially important for accessibility since it tells screen readers what the input field is for.

    for="name-input": The for attribute connects the label with the form element that has the corresponding id. 
    In this case, it connects the label to the <input> element with the id="name-input". 

    This means when the user clicks the text "Astronaut name:", the focus will 
    automatically shift to the associated input field. This improves usability.


    -------------------------------------------

    <input>: This is an HTML form element that allows the user to input data, in this case, their name.

    id="name-input": The id attribute gives this input a unique identifier that allows other elements (like the <label>) 
    or JavaScript to reference it. This is how the <label> knows which input to associate with.

    placeholder="Enter your name, space traveler!": This attribute provides a hint inside the input field to let 
    the user know what kind of information is expected. It disappears once the user starts typing. 
    In this case, it prompts the user to "Enter your name, space traveler!"
